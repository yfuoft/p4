 @book{IIDEA2021,title={The State of Democracy in the Americas 2021: Democracy in Times of Crisis}, ISBN={9789176714829}, url={https://www.idea.int/gsod/sites/default/files/2022-01/state-of-democracy-in-the-americas-2021.pdf}, DOI={10.31752/idea.2021.93}, abstractNote={The number of democracies in the Americas remains the same as two years ago despite the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, most of the democracies in the region demonstrated great resilience in the face of the pandemic. Parliaments, the judiciary and the media of most democracies in the region managed to adapt and continue to exercise their control functions, even in the midst of numerous restrictions that hampered their work. However, despite the resilience that the region’s democracies displayed during the pandemic, the quality of democracy continues to deteriorate in the Americas. More than half of the democracies in Latin America and the Caribbean show signs of democratic erosion, and Brazil’s democracy has been undergoing a process of democratic decline since 2016. The State of Democracy in the Americas 2021 offers political and civil actors, as well as the international community, analysis, lessons learned and recommendations to face the challenges that democracy presents, and to consolidate and reinforce its resilience.  International IDEA’s Global State of Democracy reports review the state of democracy around the world. The 2021 edition covers developments in 2020 and 2021, with democratic trends since 2015 used as a contextual reference. This report on the Americas is one of four regional Global State of Democracy reports, which, along with the Global Report, complement and cross-reference each other. The reports draw on data from the Global State of Democracy (GSoD) Indices and lessons learned from International IDEA’s on-the-ground technical assistance to understand the current democracy landscape. The 2021 reports also draw heavily on data collected by International IDEA’s Global Monitor of Covid-19ʼs Impact on Democracy and Human Rights.}, publisher={International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance}, author={International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance}, year={2021}, month={Nov} }
