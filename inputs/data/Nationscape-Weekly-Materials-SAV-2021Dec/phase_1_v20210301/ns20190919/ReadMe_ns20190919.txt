3) Cut AOC and Mike Pence from the favorability questions
4) Cut the Mike Pence matchup question
5) Set new display logic to show the Dem primary ranking question to show just to those who indicated that they were voting in the Democratic Primary or were not sure
6) Added 2 questions to the extra_ block for the forced choice pairs
7) Added a grid of questions to the extra_ block that lists a variety of statements and asks whether respondents agree or disagree. Everyone sees the first question and then is supposed to just see 2 options randomly selected from the remaining set.
